The Main file in the scr folder contains all the code needed to run the project
The code contains documentation comments to explain the code
An executible jar file can be found in out/artifacts/OIT_Coding_Example_Jar
The coding itself took about 1 hour and 35 minutes to complete, with a few miutes used to set up and create both the git repository, the executible and README files
**UPDATED** I realised I deleted a line necessary to function before uploading to github, the most recent update contains the added line and updated jar file
